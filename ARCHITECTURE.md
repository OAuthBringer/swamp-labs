# 3-Layer Architecture Outline

## 1. Core Processing Layer (Centralized Hub)
   - **Role**: Acts as the "brain" of the system, handling high-level processing, decision-making, and long-term storage.
   - **Components**:
     - **Event Aggregation**: Centralizes data from multiple edge devices (e.g., sensor readings, status updates).
     - **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: Handles computationally intensive tasks, such as predictive maintenance and activity recognition.
     - **Automated Decision-Making**: Defines and processes automation rules, responds to events, and coordinates actions across devices.
     - **Storage**: Stores event logs, configurations, and historical data.
     - **API and Communication Interface**: Manages API to interact with the orchestration layer and respond to events in real-time.

## 2. Orchestration Layer (Control and Deployment Engine)
   - **Role**: Manages workloads and deployments across edge devices, ensuring smooth operation and connectivity.
   - **Components**:
     - **Container Orchestration**: Deploys microservices across devices using K3s and Rancher.
     - **Device Management**: Configures and updates devices, monitors health, and assigns workloads.
     - **Network and Security Management**: Manages secure communication between devices.
     - **Policy Enforcement**: Manages operational policies and adapts workloads based on device status.

## 3. Peripherals/Device Layer (Edge Devices)
   - **Role**: Executes specific tasks based on real-time interactions and communicates with the central hub.
   - **Components**:
     - **Microservices**: Runs lightweight containers for device-specific tasks (e.g., object detection, temperature control).
     - **Sensors and Actuators**: Physical devices interacting with the environment.
     - **Local Processing**: Executes simple tasks locally to reduce latency.
     - **Communication Interface**: Sends data to the core layer via protocols like MQTT.
