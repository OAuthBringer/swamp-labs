# Project Plan: Actionables, Sprints, and Epics

## Epic 1: Core Processing Layer ("Central Brain")

### Sprint 1: Setup Virtualized Environment
   - **Actionables**:
     - Research and choose a suitable VM or container environment for development (e.g., Docker or VMware).
     - Set up a basic virtualized environment that can emulate the centralized server.
     - Configure a minimal Linux server OS to serve as the central processing hub.
   - **Outcome**: A virtualized environment where the Core Processing Layer can be developed and tested without dedicated hardware.

### Sprint 2: Core API and Communication Interface
   - **Actionables**:
     - Design REST or GraphQL API endpoints for device communication.
     - Implement basic API structure in the virtualized environment to receive data from mock edge devices.
     - Test API with simulated data to ensure data ingestion and basic responses.
   - **Outcome**: Established API for bidirectional communication between the Core Layer and peripheral devices.

### Sprint 3: Event Aggregation and Data Storage
   - **Actionables**:
     - Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB or InfluxDB) for storing events and logs.
     - Implement event aggregation functionality to collect data from the API.
     - Write scripts to store, retrieve, and query historical data for analysis.
   - **Outcome**: Data aggregation and storage module to centralize inputs from edge devices.

### Sprint 4: Machine Learning and Decision Engine
   - **Actionables**:
     - Integrate a basic machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow Lite) into the Core Layer for event prediction.
     - Develop an initial rule-based decision engine for automation and response.
     - Test the decision engine with mock data and analyze response accuracy.
   - **Outcome**: Prototype of the decision engine capable of generating automated responses based on device data.

## Epic 2: Orchestration Layer

### Sprint 1: Set Up K3s and Container Management
   - **Actionables**:
     - Install and configure K3s in the virtualized environment to simulate container orchestration.
     - Experiment with deploying simple containerized services to validate K3s setup.
     - Integrate Rancher for easier management of the K3s cluster.
   - **Outcome**: Functional K3s cluster for managing containerized services across multiple devices.

### Sprint 2: Device Management and Policy Enforcement
   - **Actionables**:
     - Implement basic device management capabilities (e.g., monitoring and updating containers).
     - Design a policy enforcement framework for defining operational rules and scaling services.
     - Test policy enforcement in response to simulated device failure or changes in network connectivity.
   - **Outcome**: Device management system with automated response capabilities.

## Epic 3: Peripherals/Device Layer

### Sprint 1: Set Up Edge Devices (Simulated or Physical)
   - **Actionables**:
     - Configure a simulated Raspberry Pi or microcontroller environment to act as a test device.
     - Set up basic sensor emulation (e.g., temperature, motion) in the simulated environment.
     - Implement MQTT or other lightweight protocols for communication with the Core Layer.
   - **Outcome**: Simulated edge device setup for testing communication and task execution.

### Sprint 2: Edge Microservices and Real-time Response
   - **Actionables**:
     - Develop a few simple microservices for the edge device layer (e.g., motion detection, temperature monitoring).
     - Test microservices independently and validate real-time response capability.
     - Configure the device layer to automatically forward critical events to the Core Layer.
   - **Outcome**: Basic microservices framework for edge devices, capable of responding to events locally and communicating with the central hub.
